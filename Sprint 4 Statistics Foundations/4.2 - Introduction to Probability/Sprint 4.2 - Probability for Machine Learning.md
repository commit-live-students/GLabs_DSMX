## SESSION PLAN

### **Session Name**: Probability for Machine Learning

**Learning Outcomes**

- Understand how to calculate the probability
- Learn how probability can be utilized in decision making
- Understand and differentiate between various probability distributions
- Apply principles of probability to answers questions on real data


**Prerequisites for the Students**

- Probability for Machine Learning - Go through the concept and solve the tasks and assessments.
 
**Student Activities**

- Discuss with the Mentor what you have learned.

- Overview of Summarizing Data with Statistics
  - Conditional Probability & Bayes Theorem
  - Probability Distributions
- How many ways are there to split 10 people into 2 teams so that they can play 5 on 5 basketball?
- One hundred people line up to board an aeroplane. Each has a boarding pass with an assigned seat. However, the first person to the board has lost his boarding pass and takes a random seat. After that, each person takes  the assigned seat if it is unoccupied, and one of the unoccupied seats at random otherwise. What is the probability that the last person to board gets to sit in his assigned seat?
- A classic example: The famous Monty Hall Problem (10 min)
You’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? Will you switch or stay with your door?

- Questions and Discussion on doubts - AMA
- Team Activity - It is ok to be wrong and the whole point of the activity is to make you think. You will have to fill a google form as part of the activity with your answers. (Refer the GitHub repo to see the [Activity]())


**Next Session**
