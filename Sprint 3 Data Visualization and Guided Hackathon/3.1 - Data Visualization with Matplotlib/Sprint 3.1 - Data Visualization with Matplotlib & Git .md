  - Drawing Multiple Plots
- Learn about version control and get acquainted with using Git for creating and making changes in a repository on GitHub.
- Get to learn about the importance of coding standards in Python such as PEP8, PEP257 also learn to implement them.

- Code Walkthrough (refer the GitHub repo [Code Walkthrough](https://github.com/commit-live-students/GLabs_DSMX/tree/master/Sprint%203%20Data%20Visualization%20and%20Guided%20Hackathon/3.1%20-%20Data%20Visualization%20with%20Matplotlib/Code%20Walkthrough))
- Questions and Discussion on doubts - AMA
- Team Activity - It is ok to be wrong and the whole point of the activity is to make you think. You will have to fill a google form as part of the activity with your answers. (Refer the GitHub repo to see the [Activity]())
