Proventus Consulting,Research Analyst/ Data Intern,"Job Summary
Job Summary
Business databases store vast amounts of information, but executives need data analysts to transform this data into business intelligence. Analysts sort and aggregate data, develop statistical models and present their findings to decision makers. At the entry level, data collection specialists work closely with data analysts to gather data, create and administer surveys, build presentations and write reports. The job requires some background in math, statistics and computer skills as well as an ability to communicate effectively.
**.
Responsibilities and Duties
Responsibilities and Duties
Gather Data
At the heart of every data analysis is a pool of events or observations coded into a set of numbers and text values. Often, this data can be found in corporate databases or from a variety of public sources. At other times, it may require surveys gathered through interviews or mailings. Data collection support specialists may conduct interviews or collect surveys, then key the data into spreadsheets or databases. Other data may be gathered by creating programs that filter and extract data from corporate databases or by conducting research to locate the numbers from public databases.
Clean Data
Once a data set has been built, the data collection specialist may need to clean the data to remove bad values, correct misspelled names, make sure addresses have consistent formats or fill in missing values. In some cases this is done manually, scrolling through spreadsheets to make corrections. In other cases, she may write programs to perform these tasks for larger data sets. While sometimes tedious, this work is vital to the success of the project.
Analyze Data
Under the supervision of a senior team member, the data collection specialist may be asked to perform some of the basic statistical work. She may filter and sort the data in several ways; count frequencies by age, gender or other measurements; calculate means and standard deviations; or measure correlations between sets of data. These observations are then printed or saved in computer files for use by the data analysts

Activities will involve business analysis, industry analysis, database management, scientific research and reporting, monitoring incoming emails and responding, other tasks related to managing the fund.

Vahanalytics,Data Scientist,"ur vision is to help make ‘better drivers, through smart data’ - we are achieving this through the use of simple smartphones.

We are looking for a Data Scientist co-founder, to help transition from a consumer facing transportation solution to a data science based technology solution for all business, startups and drivers in the transportation sector.
We are looking to improve the hardest and most important component of the $280 Bn Indian logistics and transportation markets - the humans who drive the vehicles.

Your job as a Data Scientist co-founder would be to design the most efficient algorithms to make actionable sense of the smartphone sensor data we capture, from all drivers. This would include extracting specific information about each driver’s driving behaviour, collated with other sources of data like traffic and weather conditions - to create each driver’s driving profile.
The end goal would be to group drivers into various grades based on their profiles, and then use the data we have to train them to become better drivers.
It is a challenging technological problem - which is why we are looking for somebody more than just an employee.
We need a Data Scientist who will directly contribute to the DNA of the company.

Pentagon Global Solutions Limited,Front End Developer,"A front-end web developer is probably what most people think of as a “web developer”. A front-end web developer is responsible for implementing visual elements that users see and interact with in a web application. They are usually supported by back-end web developers, who are responsible for server-side application logic and integration of the work front-end developers do.
Writing a good job description and a corresponding job ad requires proper separation of concerns. Posting a generic web developer job description in your ad when you are looking for an advanced front-end web developer, will bring numerous applications from people who are specialized in building back-end web services, or web designers who have absolutely no knowledge about programming.
There are technologies and knowledge that are common to all web developer jobs. This article will provide you with a sample front-end web developer job description that will help you write a perfect job ad and assure that you easily find and hire the person that matches your specific criteria.

Caution against fraudulent job offers!

We have been informed of instances where jobseekers are led to believe of fictitious job opportunities with Deloitte India (“Deloitte”). In one or more such cases, false promises of actual or potential selection, or initiation or completion of the recruitment formalities appear to have been or are being made. Some jobseekers appear to have been asked to pay money to specified bank accounts of individuals or entities as a condition of their selection for a ‘job’ with Deloitte. These individuals or entities are in no way connected with Deloitte and do not represent or otherwise act on behalf of Deloitte.

We would like to clarify that:
At Deloitte, ethics and integrity are fundamental and not negotiable.
We are against corruption and neither offer bribes nor accept them, nor induce or permit any other party to make or receive bribes on our behalf.
We have not authorised any party or person to collect any money from jobseekers in any form whatsoever for promises of getting jobs in Deloitte.
We consider candidates only on merit and that we provide an equal opportunity to eligible applicants.
No one other than an authorised official of Deloitte is permitted to confirm any job offer from Deloitte.
Anyone who at any time has made or makes any payment to any party against promises of job or selection for a job with Deloitte or any matter related to this (including those for ‘registration’, ‘verification’ or ‘security deposit’) or otherwise engages with any such person who has made or makes fraudulent promises or offers, does so (or has done so) entirely at their own risk. Deloitte takes no responsibility or liability for any such unauthorised or fraudulent actions or engagements.
We encourage jobseekers to exercise caution. If you have queries about the veracity of a job offer you have received which relates to Deloitte or would like to report a fraud with regard to job offers with Deloitte, please send an email to inhiringalert@deloitte.com

Pentagon Global Solutions Limited,Front End Developer,"A front-end web developer is probably what most people think of as a “web developer”. A front-end web developer is responsible for implementing visual elements that users see and interact with in a web application. They are usually supported by back-end web developers, who are responsible for server-side application logic and integration of the work front-end developers do.
Writing a good job description and a corresponding job ad requires proper separation of concerns. Posting a generic web developer job description in your ad when you are looking for an advanced front-end web developer, will bring numerous applications from people who are specialized in building back-end web services, or web designers who have absolutely no knowledge about programming.
There are technologies and knowledge that are common to all web developer jobs. This article will provide you with a sample front-end web developer job description that will help you write a perfect job ad and assure that you easily find and hire the person that matches your specific criteria.
Develop new user-facing features.
Build reusable code and libraries for future use.
Ensure the technical feasibility of UI/UX designs.
Optimize application for maximum speed and scalability.
Assure that all user input is validated before submitting to back-end.

Pentagon Global Solutions Limited,Front End Developer,"A front-end web developer is probably what most people think of as a “web developer”. A front-end web developer is responsible for implementing visual elements that users see and interact with in a web application. They are usually supported by back-end web developers, who are responsible for server-side application logic and integration of the work front-end developers do.
Writing a good job description and a corresponding job ad requires proper separation of concerns. Posting a generic web developer job description in your ad when you are looking for an advanced front-end web developer, will bring numerous applications from people who are specialized in building back-end web services, or web designers who have absolutely no knowledge about programming.
There are technologies and knowledge that are common to all web developer jobs. This article will provide you with a sample front-end web developer job description that will help you write a perfect job ad and assure that you easily find and hire the person that matches your specific criteria.

About the job
Whether you're on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product's journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you'll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.
As a YouTube Culture and Trends Manager at Google, you'll have the opportunity to shape and improve understanding of YouTube. You'll join the YouTube Culture and Trends team, which uses data to track trends and connect YouTube stories and content to users. This includes community-focused initiatives, as well as other projects built around popular content across entertainment, news, music, and more. You'll oversee communication around popular trends, channels, and videos and develop calendar-based and breaking news programming strategies. You'll leverage data and research to create positive, engaging user experiences on a daily basis and work with cross-functional teams to tell stories that bring context to what's happening on YouTube. The role will require you to be immersed in the YouTube community and daily social media conversation.
Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems-from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can-changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.
Responsibilities
Advocate for YouTube to stakeholders including media, partners, opinion formers, and advertisers. Identify and articulate the positive social impact of YouTube’s content, creators, and communities.
Leverage data to understand the audience, drive program strategies, and support marketing and communication initiatives with culture and trends research. Translate video data into cultural insights.
Manage a local programming coordination effort, review and organize popular videos, and take into account policies and considerations. Assess and make decisions about the appropriateness of different content for various audiences and provide an expert view on cultural sensitivities.
Develop programs to celebrate and engage with the YouTube community around holidays and current events.
Serve as a local expert on YouTube videos, channels, and fandom and track the latest memes and trends. Represent YouTube as a spokesperson or by delivering presentations about local trends.
At Google, we don’t just accept difference—we celebrate it, we support it, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our products and our community. Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.
